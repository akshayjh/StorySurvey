                            DURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring,
                            I had returned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore
                            the Nebraska badlands in the United States.  In my capacity as
                            Assistant Professor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had
                            been attached to this expedition by the French government.
                            After spending six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden
                            with valuable collections near the end of March.  My departure
                            for France was set for early May.  In the meantime, then, I was busy
                            classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and zoological treasures
                            when that incident took place with the Scotia.

                            WE COME TO the conclusion of this voyage under the seas.
                            What happened that night, how the skiff escaped from the Maelstrom's
                            fearsome eddies, how Ned Land, Conseil, and I got out of that whirlpool,
                            I'm unable to say. But when I regained consciousness, I was lying
                            in a fisherman's hut on one of the Lofoten Islands.  My two companions,
                            safe and sound, were at my bedside clasping my hands.
                            We embraced each other heartily.
