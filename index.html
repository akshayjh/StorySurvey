                                    DURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring,
                                    I had returned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore
                                    the Nebraska badlands in the United States.  In my capacity as
                                    Assistant Professor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had
                                    been attached to this expedition by the French government.
                                    After spending six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden
                                    with valuable collections near the end of March.  My departure
                                    for France was set for early May.  In the meantime, then, I was busy
                                    classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and zoological treasures
                                    when that incident took place with the Scotia.

                                    WE COME TO the conclusion of this voyage under the seas.
                                    What happened that night, how the skiff escaped from the Maelstrom's
                                    fearsome eddies, how Ned Land, Conseil, and I got out of that whirlpool,
                                    I'm unable to say. But when I regained consciousness, I was lying
                                    in a fisherman's hut on one of the Lofoten Islands.  My two companions,
                                    safe and sound, were at my bedside clasping my hands.
                                    We embraced each other heartily.
